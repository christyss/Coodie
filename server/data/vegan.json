When the oil is hot, pour in half of the mixture and move the pan around to form a circle and until the omelette is approx. 18cm (7inches) in diameter. Cover with a lid and steam fry for 5 minutes. Add half of the cooked veggies from earlier to one side of the omelette and carefully fold the remaining half on top. If it feels like the omelette is about to break, leave it to fry for another minute then try again",
